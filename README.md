# 🧠 LeetCode — Problem of the Day

> *One problem a day keeps the bugs away.*

## What's This? 🤔

This repo is my **daily commitment** to solving LeetCode's Problem of the Day — every. single. day. No skipping, no excuses. Just consistent grinding, one problem at a time.

The goal is simple: show up daily, think hard, write clean Java, and track how far consistency can take you.

## Why Bother? 💪

Because consistency beats intensity. You don't get better at problem solving by doing 100 problems in a weekend and burning out. You get better by showing up **every day**, even when the problem is hard, even when you don't feel like it.

This repo is proof of that commitment.
